## Pseudo Code

*   The Password Generator must return a random password based on a series of questions/prompts to the end user after the end user clicks the 'Generate Password' button.

*   The questions the end user must answer to successfully generate a password are:

    *   Q1: Please choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters long.
    *   Q2: Should the password contain Numbers?
    *   Q3: Should the password contain Lowercase Letters?
    *   Q4: Should the password contain Uppercase Letters?
    *   Q5: Should the password contain Special Characters?

*   Q1: Please choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters long.

    *   The user must be advised of the minimum and maximum character choice available.
    *   If the number input by the end user is outside of 8 - 128, the user must be prompted to try again.
    *   If the number input by the end user is between 8 and 128, the next question must be presented.

*   Q2-Q5: These questions are of Yes or No choice, for this a true or false confirm can be used.

    *   If the answer to any of these questions is True, the respective characters need to be in the randomly generated password.
    *   If the answer to any of these questions is false, we need to filter/excluded these from the randomly generated password.
    *   If a user chooses false to all of these questions, no password can be generated. The page will then need to notify the end user that they must at a minimum include at least one of the character types or the password to be generated.
